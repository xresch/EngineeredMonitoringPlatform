# EngineeredMonitoringPlatform

The Engineered Monitoring Platform(EMP) is a project which arised from the need to have a easy to customize Monitoring & Dashboarding solution. Company specific needs can easily be implemented through extensions and therefore can be tailored to a lot of situations. With a flexible Role & permission management it allows to grant access in verious ways, from public dashboards that do not need any login down to sharing dashboards with specific users and groups.
EMP is built upon the CoreFramework(CFW) project.

The following were the goals in mind when EMP was created:
- Dashboarding of status information (green, yellow red) for a lot of data.
- Dashboarding of time based information (charts)
- Dashboards can have customized parameters
- eMail Alerting based on widget settings (if supported by widget)
- Flexible Permission Management (Users/Roles/Permissions)
- Extendable with custom widgets to tailor it to specific needs.
