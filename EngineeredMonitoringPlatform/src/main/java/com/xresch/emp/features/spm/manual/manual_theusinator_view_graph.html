<p>
This view is not meant to be used as a monitoring tool but to provide more insights into a single project.
In contrast to the other four views, this view can provide data of all measures which are available for
the project. The time frame for which data is to be displayed can be chosen from a set of standard time
frames, as well as through a date picker which allows for custom time frames. Additionally the time
span for which multiple values are being merged into one can be selected from a set of options.
</p>

<p>The user can choose between five different chart types:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Area Chart</li>
	<li>Bar Chart</li>
	<li>Donut Chart</li>
	<li>Line Chart</li>
	<li>Pie Chart</li>
</ul>

<p>The following measures are available:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Overall Health</li>
	<li>Accuracy</li>
	<li>Availability</li>
	<li>Page HTML download time (overall response time)</li>
	<li>Page round trip time (overall response time)</li>
	<li> Page server busy time (overall response time)</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Transaction Response Time</li>
</ul>

<p>The user can choose between the following merge spans:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Weekly</li>
	<li>Daily</li>
	<li>Hourly</li>
	<li>Quarter of an Hour</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the aforementioned measures, the following data can be retrieved:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Average</li>
	<li>boundCount1</li>
	<li>boundCount2</li>
	<li>max</li>
	<li>min</li>
	<li>sum</li>
	<li>sumSquared</li>
</ul>

<p>The provided standard time frames are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Last Year</li>
	<li>Last Month</li>
	<li>Last Week</li>
	<li>Last 24 Hours</li>
	<li>Last Hour</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to server side restrictions, not all time frames are compatible with all merge spans. The following
combinations are allowed:</p>

<table class="table table-responsive table-striped table-hover">
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Merge Span</th>
		<th>Allowed Time</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>Quarter of an hour</td>
		<td>Up to two months (60 days)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Hourly</td>
		<td>Up to three months (90 days)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Daily</td>
		<td>Up to two years (730 days)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Weekly</td>
		<td>Up to two years (730 days)</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Even though time frames of up to two years are allowed, that does not necessarily mean that there are
actually data points available for last two years.
