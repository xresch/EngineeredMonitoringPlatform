<p>
The Dashboard View is the most basic view which shows all of the user’s projects as square tiles, filled
with color depending on the project’s overall health of the last hour. The intention of this view is to
provide a traffic light system which allows the user to see the health of his projects at a glance. A tile
consists of the project’s environment variable, TID, name and custom tag (optional).
