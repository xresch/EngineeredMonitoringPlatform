<h2>Dynatrace Widgets Setup</h2>
<p>
Before the Dynatrace widgets can be used, at least one Dynatrace environment has to be defined by a user with admin permissions.
The environments can be added in the Context Settings found under &quot;Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;. The settings will need the API URL and an API token from the Dynatrace instance.
</p>


<h2>API Limitations</h2>
<p>
The API has the following known limitations;
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>SaaS Requests: </strong>Dynatrace SaaS solution has a limitation of 50 request/min. Extensive use of Dynatrace widgets can easily reach this limit and will result in error messages. This is not the case with on-premise solutions.</li>
	<li><strong>Timeframes: </strong>Various API calls have limitations on the maximum timeframe they can access. In case such a limit is reached, a warning message is displayed for each widget running into this issue.</li>
</ul>
