<h2>InfluxDB Widgets Setup</h2>
<p>
Before the InfluxDB widgets can be used, at least one InfluxDB environment has to be defined by a user with admin permissions.
The environments can be added in the Context Settings found under &quot;Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;.
</p>


<h2>The Query Placeholders</h2>
<p>
In order to get the time picker working properly with the widgets, placeholders for time and interval have to be added to the queries. 
The following placeholders are available:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>[earliest]:<b>&nbsp;</b>This placeholder will be replaced by the earliest time choosen with the time picker in nanoseconds. </li>
	<li>[latest]:<b>&nbsp;</b>This placeholder will be replaced by the latest time chosen with the time picker in nanoseconds.</li>
	<li>[interval]:<b>&nbsp;</b>This placeholder will be replaced by an interval string(1m, 5m, 1h, 24h etc...). The interval is based on the span selected timeframe, to provide a good granularity while keeping performance in mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a InfluxQL widget is created, it will contain the following example query, that shows how the placeholders can be used:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT mean(*)
FROM runtime 
WHERE time &gt;= [earliest] and time &lt; [latest] group by time([interval]);
</code></pre>

<h2>Widgets</h2>
<h3>InfluxQL Threshold</h3>
<p>
The InfluxQL Threshold widget is used to execute a InfluxQL query and display its results as tiles, panels or as a table.
The widget fetches the data of the latest time picked with the time frame picker.
You can define thresholds for the values you retrieved to indicate a status with various colors.
</p>
<p><b>Compatibility Notice:</b> This widget is using the API version v1 used in InfluxDB 1.x. As of the official documentation, this should also work with InfluxDB 2.x if the bucket is mapped to a database.</p>

<h3>InfluxQL Chart</h3>
<p>
The InfluxQL Chart widget is used to execute one or multiple queries and display the results as a chart.
The widget fetches the data for the time chosen with the time frame picker.
The legend in the chart will use the metric labels for the title of the series.
