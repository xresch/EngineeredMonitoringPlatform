<p>
The Box View shows the user’s projects with their overall health during the last twelve or twenty-four
hours. Every hour is represented by a square inside the tile, below the project’s name. The oldest value
is in the top left, the latest in the bottom right of the tile. If a project’s current health drops below 75%,
a border with the according color marks the tile to make it stand out. The intention of this view is to give
the user a more detailed overview of their projects than in the dashboard view while at the same time
retaining high visibility of all of the user’s projects.
