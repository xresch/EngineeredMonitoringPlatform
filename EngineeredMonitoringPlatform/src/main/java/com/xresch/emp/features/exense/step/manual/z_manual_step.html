<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
Before the Step features can be used, at least one Exense STEP connection has to be defined by a user with admin permissions.
The environments can be added in the Context Settings found under &quot;Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;.
Hover the info icon next to the settings fields to get more info about what you need to fill in.
When saving the STEP context setting, all the scheduler will be reloaded, what might take several minutes depending on the number of schedulers you have. 
</p>


<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>
Several Widgets are included in the Exense Step feature.
Please find their documentation in this manual under section  <a href="#" onclick="cfw_manual_loadPage('Dashboard|Widgets|Exense Step');">Dashboard &gt;&gt; Widgets &gt;&gt; Exense Step</a>
</p>



<h3>Widget Status Colors & Thresholds</h3>
<p>
The status colors displayed are defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Step Result: &nbsp;</b>The result of the STEP execution, like RUNNING,PASSED, FAILED etc...</li>
	<li>
		<b>Custom Performance Thresholds(optional): &nbsp;</b>Most STEP widgets provide threshold fields. 
		If the execution has status PASSED, and at least one threshold is defined, thresholds will be evaluated. 
		Define a time in milliseconds that will evaluate the duration of the scheduler execution.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
The colors are as follow:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-green">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Green: &nbsp;</b>PASSED / Custom Threshold </li>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-limegreen">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Lime Green: &nbsp;</b>Custom Threshold </li>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-yellow">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Yellow: &nbsp;</b>Custom Threshold </li>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-orange">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Orange: &nbsp;</b>VETOED / SKIPPED / INTERRUPTED / Custom Threshold </li>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-red">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Red: &nbsp;</b>FAILED / Custom Threshold</li>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-black">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Black: &nbsp;</b>BLACK</li>
	<li>  <div class="cfw-color-box bg-cfw-blue">&nbsp;</div>  <b>Black: &nbsp;</b>RUNNING </li>
</ul>



<h3>Widget Performance</h3>
<p>
The performance of the widgets depends on the following factors:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>STEP: &nbsp;</b>The capacity and infrastructure available to the STEP instance.</li>
	<li><b>Widget: &nbsp;</b>The widget you are using and what settings you have set.</li>
	<li><b>Data &amp; Timeframe: &nbsp;</b>The amount of data which is loaded. For time-based widgets, this can highly be influenced by the size of the timeframe you select.</li>
</ul>



<h2>API Endpoint</h2>
<p>
The EMP API provides an endpoint named "ExenseStep" to fetch execution status data from STEP.
Please go to the API UI to find the documentation about the available requests and create request examples.
