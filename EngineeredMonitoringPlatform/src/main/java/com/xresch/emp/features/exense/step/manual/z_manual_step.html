<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
Before the Step features can be used, at least one Exense STEP connection has to be defined by a user with admin permissions.
The environments can be added in the Context Settings found under &quot;Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;.
Hover the info icon next to the settings fields to get more info about what you need to fill in.
When saving the STEP context setting, all the scheduler will be reloaded, what might take several minutes depending on the number of schedulers you have. 
</p>


<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>
Several Widgets are included in the Exense Step feature.
Please find their documentation in this manual under section  <a href="#" onclick="cfw_manual_loadPage('Dashboard|Widgets|Exense Step');">Dashboard &gt;&gt; Widgets &gt;&gt; Exense Step</a>

<ul>
	<li><b>Step Result: &nbsp;</b>The result of the STEP execution, like RUNNING,PASSED, FAILED etc...</li>
