<p>
The option to set the time frame is available in all four monitoring views, the options for toggling the
environments, project names or TIDs and custom tags in Dashboard and Box View only.
</p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>There is an input field at the top of each of the four monitoring views just below the various selectors,
which provides the possibility to filter which projects are to be displayed. The filtering takes into
account:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Project Name</li>
	<li>Environment</li>
	<li>TID (Technical ID)</li>
	<li>Custom Tag</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zoom</h2>
<p>To use the available screen space as efficiently as possible, the new dashboards let the user set the size
of the tiles. This feature is available in the Dashboard, Box and Status views and has the following options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Default</li>
	<li>Micro</li>
	<li>Mini</li>
	<li>Small</li>
	<li>1.5x</li>
	<li>2x</li>
	<li>2.5x</li>
	<li>3x</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also still use "Ctrl + Mousewheel" to zoom in or out.</p>

<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>The out of the box SPM page refresh will be deactivated in this application as it always reloads the entire
page and allows for refresh times which are so low that the application becomes unusable. Users should
use the provided refresh option instead, as it will only update the content that needs updating, which
leads to faster refresh times.</p>

<p>The user can choose from the following options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deactivated</li>
	<li>5 Minutes</li>
	<li>10 Minutes</li>
	<li>15 Minutes</li>
	<li>30 Minutes</li>
	<li>60 Minutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>The user can sort their projects by the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>By Full Name (includes environment and TID)</li>
	<li>By Project Name</li>
	<li>By Environment</li>
	<li>By TID (Technical ID)</li>
	<li>By Custom Tag</li>
</ul>

<p>This will influence the order in which the tiles in the Dashboard, Box and Status views are drawn, their
order in the table in the Health History View and the order in which they're listed in the project selector
in the Graph View.</p>
