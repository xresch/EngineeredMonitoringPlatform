<p>
The Status View shows the user’s projects with their overall health during the last twelve/twenty-four
hours. Every hour is represented by a slice of the donut inside the tile, below the project’s name. The
most recent measure is in the top left, the oldest in the top right of the donut. If a projects current health
drops below 75%, a border with the according color is added to the tile to make the project stand out.
The intention of this view is to give the user a more detailed overview of their projects than in the
dashboard view while at the same time retaining high visibility of the user’s projects. The donut chart is
meant to remind the user of a clock where the measured values go back in time counter clockwise.
