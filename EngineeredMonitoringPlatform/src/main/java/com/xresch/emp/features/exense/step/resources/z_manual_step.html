<h3>Plan Status by Projects</h3>
<p>
The widget takes one or more projects as an input, fetches and displays the last execution status for all plan of the selected projects.
It also provides threshold settings that will color the tile based on the duration value.
If no threshold is provided, the colors are determined by the execution result.
