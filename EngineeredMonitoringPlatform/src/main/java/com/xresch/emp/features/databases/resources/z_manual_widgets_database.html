<h2>Database Widgets Introduction</h2>
<p>
There are  widgets available for various databases:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>MySQL</strong></li>
	<li><strong>MSSQL</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Oracle</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Generic JDBC:&nbsp;</strong>For any other database type for which a JDBC driver is available. 
	            Copy the drivers jar-File to the {APP_ROOT}/extensions(and it's dependencies, if any) and restart the application to be able to use the driver.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before the database widgets can be used, at least one database environment for the respective database type has to be defined by a user with admin permissions.
The environments can be added under &quot;Admin &gt;&gt; Context Settings&quot;.
</p>

<h2>Widgets Settings</h2>
<p>
All the database widgets have similar settings that can be used to define what and how the widget should display the data.
You can get a quick guide by hovering on the info icon next to the settings field.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Environment:&nbsp;</strong>The environment to fetch the data from.</li>
	<li><strong>Query:&nbsp;</strong>The select query that should be executed to retrieve data from the database.</li>
	<li><strong>Value Column:&nbsp;</strong> The name of the column used for evaluating against the thresholds. The values in the column have to be numbers. 
	    					  				 If this is not specified, the last column in the query result will be used.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Label Columns:&nbsp;</strong> List of comma separated column name(s) used as labels for tile, panel and card Headers, as well as specifying the item in alert messages. 
	    					  				 If this is not specified, the first column in the query result will be used.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Detail Columns:&nbsp;</strong> List of comma separated column name(s) shown as details. Also used in alert messages to give more details. 
	    					  				 If this is not specified, all column in the query result will be used. If you don't want to show any additional details, put a column name that does not exist.
	</li>
	<li><strong>URL Column:&nbsp;</strong> (Optional)The name of the column which contains a URL and should be converted into a link.</li>
	<li><strong>Threshold Fields:&nbsp;</strong> Used to specify the thresholds. You can leave a threshold empty to skip it, for example if you only want to have 3 instead of 5 threshold levels.
											They can be used bidirectional, either increasing or decreasing values from excellent to danger. Values lower than the smallest threshold value are not evaluated. 
											Thresholds are not evaluated if all are empty. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>Disable Thresholds:&nbsp;</strong>To disable the evaluation, for example during expected maintenance periods. Color will be dark gray. </li>
	<li><strong>Display As And Tiles Settings:&nbsp;</strong>Choose how the data should be represented on the dashboard.</li>
	<li><strong>Example Mode:&nbsp;</strong> If true, loads example data instead of querying the database.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Alerting Task</h3>
<p>
All the database widgets support an alerting task. To define such a task, edit the widget and change to the tab "Task Settings".
There you can define a task which will executed periodically in the background, evaluating thresholds based on the settings defined for this specific widget.
Will send an alert then the selected threshold is reached.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> There are as well separate job tasks available to do alerting based on database queries. In case you do not want to alerting without a widget.</p>
