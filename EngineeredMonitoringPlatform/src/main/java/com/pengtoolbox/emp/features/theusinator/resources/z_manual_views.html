The Theusinator features five views to monitor and analyze the user’s projects.
Four of them (Dashboard, Box, Health History and Status) are meant to provide the user with an
overview of all their project’s current health, so that problems with any of the projects can be detected
easily.

The fifth view (Graph) aims to provide the user with a deeper insight into one of their projects at a time.
With a variety of measures and time frames to choose from, this view delivers all the necessary tools to
analyze every aspect of a project during time frames of up to two years.
