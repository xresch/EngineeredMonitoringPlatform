<p>
This view was designed to be an optimization of the existing health history view of Silk Performance Manager.
It is meant for users who wish to keep monitoring their projects in the same way they did before the
introduction of the new dashboards. The projects are listed in a table with their name, health during the
last twelve/twenty-four hours and their current health.
</p>
<p>
The header of the table features a legend which labels each column of the health history with its time
difference to the current time, which helps to understand when a project encountered issues.
</p>
<p>
Each project’s health history is displayed as a row of twelve/twenty-four rectangles with a different
color, depending on the project’s health at that time. Hovering over any of those rectangles will show a
tooltip with the project’s health at that point in time.
