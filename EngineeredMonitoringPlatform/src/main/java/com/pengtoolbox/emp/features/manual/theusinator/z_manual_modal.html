<p>Modals can be accessed from each of the four monitoring views:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Box</li>
	<li>Health History</li>
	<li>Status</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clicking on any of the projects (tile or row in Health History View) will open a modal panel with
additional information about the project. There are seven tabs, six of which show data for different
measures of the project while the seventh provides some facts about the project (project description) and
the option to add and remove a custom tag.
</p>

<h2>Measure Tabs</h2>
<p>The six measure tabs are named:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Overall Health</li>
	<li>Availability</li>
	<li>Accuracy</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Page Round Trip Time</li>
	<li>Custom Timers</li>
</ul>
<p>
They all show a table and two charts with data from the last twelve/twenty-four hours, depending on
which time frame was selected in the option panel. 
</p>

<p>The table shows the following measures:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Average</li>
	<li>Maximum</li>
	<li>Minimum</li>
	<li>Median</li>
	<li>90th Percentile</li>
	<li>Standard Deviation</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these measures relate to the averages and not the absolute values. This means that the maximum
and minimum represent the extrema of the averages over the last twelve/twenty-four hours, not the actual
maximum and minimum values that were recorded. This is the case because the table might otherwise
show values which are not represented in the two charts. If a user wishes to see the actual extrema of a
project in a specific time frame they can do so in the Graph View.
</p>
<p>
The chart below the table simply shows the averages of the measure that is currently selected (current
tab) over the last twelve/twenty-four hours. The user may choose between the following five chart types:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Area Chart</li>
	<li>Bar Chart</li>
	<li>Donut Chart</li>
	<li>Line Chart</li>
	<li>Pie Chart</li>
</ul>
<p>
The chart in the right half of the modal panel will always show a donut chart with data from the last
twelve/twenty-four hours. The user can hover over each of the slices to reveal the timestamp and the
corresponding value. An Info icon can also be found in the top left of the right half which explains how
to read the donut chart.
</p>


<h2>Project Description Tab</h2>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/cfw/jarresource?pkg=com.pengtoolbox.emp.features.manual.theusinator&file=z_manual_modal_projectdescription.png">
<p>
The Project Description tab features additional information about the project in the form of a table. This
table is filled dynamically and depends on the project's description, which can be set by the SPM Team
under "Administration >> Projects". These are currently set for all projects which were active at the
time of writing this guide. If you activate other projects and wish to have the project description show
up in the modal like in the image above, you have to add the information to the project description as 
described in the manual page <a href="#" onclick="cfw_manual_loadPage('Engineered Montitoring Platform(EMP)|Theusinator|Setup');">Setup</a>.
</p>

<p>
The custom tag which can be set in the other half of the modal panel will also be listed here. Users can
set one custom tag per project which can be between one and eight characters long. These tags can be
used for sorting and filtering and will also be visible in the tiles in the Dashboard and Box views.
