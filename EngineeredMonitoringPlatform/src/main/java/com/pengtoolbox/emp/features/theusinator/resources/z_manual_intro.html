Theusinator is a custom dashboard for Silk Performance Manager(SPM). </br>
The dashboard was designed in such a way that users can always see all of their active monitored projects and projects
that are reporting any kind of issue are easily recognizable. Additionally, the user can choose between
different amounts of information they would like to see and how they want that information to be
displayed. To that purpose, the application offers five different views for the user to choose from and
various options to customize these views.
All data which is used in the new dashboards is obtained via the SPM API, which leads to all displayed
time frames and timestamps being standardized to UTC time.
