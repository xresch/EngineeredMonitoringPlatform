A nice and free data visualization tool that allows you to fast and easily fetch data from a database, a Web API, a file or other sources and put it up on a dashboard as needed.
You can also create your own customized widgets based on parameterized queries, and these customized widgets are easy to use for non-techies.

Here is an example of the query language:

| source jdbc
	environment={"id":1234,"name":"H2 EMP"} 
	query=`
		SELECT * 
		FROM mighty_table 
		WHERE DATE >= "`+earliest("yyyy-MM-dd")+`" 
		  AND DATE <= "`+latest("yyyy-MM-dd")+`"
		ORDER BY time DESC
		`
| formatrecord 
	[(VALUE >= 80), "cfw-red"] 
	[(VALUE >= 60), "cfw-orange"]  
	[(VALUE >= 40), "cfw-yellow", "purple"] 
	[(VALUE >= 20), "cfw-limegreen"] 
	[(VALUE >= 10), "cfw-green"] 
	[true, "cfw-gray"] 
| formatfield LIKES_TIRAMISU=none
| display 
	as = statusmap
	menu = false
